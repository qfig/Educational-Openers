# Educational-Openers

The place where you can stop your school.

**Note: These will only unblock the extensions that are client side, anything server side like a firewall won't be stopped with these.**


# Some basic instructions for these
You will need to know that these are executed via BookMarklets. BookMarklets are javascript inside of a BookMark that gets ran when clicked.
Make sure you copy the `javascript:` in the beginning.


# Extension Panel
This BookMarklet will give you access to a panel to disable any extensions. (Aristole, Securly, GoGuardian, etc)
Open the `Turn-Off-Extensions` file and **click raw** then select all on the new page with CTRL+A and copy it into a bookmark.
Load a new tab and go to Google.com and run the extension. **You will get an error** when you load it, if you load it one more time you will get access to any and all extensions in your chromebook.


# Inspect Element and Console
This BookMarklet will give you access to JavaScript console and Inspect Element, Simply open the `Inspect-Element-and-Console` file and **click raw** then select all on the new page with CTRL+A and copy it into a bookmark. Then load whatever you want to edit or cheat in like [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) (Tip, you can find cheats for Cookie Clicker [Here](https://www.radiotimes.com/technology/gaming/cookie-clicker-cheats/))


# document.designMode Cheat
This BookMarklet is a lot like the javascript you can run called `document.designMode = 'on'` that lets you edit text right on the page without directly searching through Inspect Element. Simply open the `document.designMode-Cheat` file and **click raw** then select all on the new page with CTRL+A and copy it into a bookmark. Run it on a page and your good to go.
